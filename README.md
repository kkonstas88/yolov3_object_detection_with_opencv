# Object detection using deep learning with OpenCV and Python 
OpenCV `dnn` module supports running inference on pre-trained deep learning models from popular frameworks like Caffe, Torch and TensorFlow. 

When it comes to object detection, popular frameworks are
 * YOLO
 * SSD
 * Faster R-CNN
 
 Support for running YOLO/DarkNet has been added to OpenCV dnn module recently. 
 
 ## YOLO (You Only Look Once)
 `$ python yolo_opencv.py`
 
 **SSD and Faster R-CNN examples will be added soon**
